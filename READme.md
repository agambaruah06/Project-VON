**Project Von** is a personal AI mentor memory system—a carefully structured JSON-based design for tracking goals, habits, and coaching sessions with a privacy-first mindset.  

This repository is part of my own research into transparent, human-centered AI memory design.

---

## 📌 Purpose
- Experiment with structured goal and habit tracking in JSON
- Learn best practices in schema design, privacy controls, and documentation
- Build a foundation for AI mentoring systems that empower user autonomy

---

## ✨ Why It Matters
- Empower users with data autonomy
- Reflect the user’s complexity with structured empathy
- Design systems that heal, not just optimize

---

## ⚡️ Features
- Structured memory JSON with goals, habits, metrics, crisis protocols
- Privacy-focused design (AES-256 encryption planning, zero-knowledge approach)
- Custom metric definitions and progress tracking
- Session context with flags for nuanced coaching interactions

---

## 🔧 Technical Overview
- **Memory Format**: Hierarchical, human-readable JSON
- **Privacy**: Local storage, AES-256 encryption planning
- **Session Management**: Sliding window with session flags
- **Compatibility**: Designed for AI mentor or personal productivity systems

---

## 🚀 Current Status
**Exploratory Phase** – Active personal research and design:
- ✅ Core memory structure defined
- 🔄 Testing privacy approaches
- 📋 Iterating on real-world use cases
- ❌ Not production-ready
